The data came in a tabular format and I started my analysis by carrying out and ETL (Extract,Transform,Load)process. 
### Analysis
1.The data was transfrmed to make it more readable such as the dates columns (column I and J) by using the excel date formating formula.

2.Key metrics were created such as Average Donation in (column P) and percentage and percentage funded in (column O).

3.A pivot table was created and filtered by using theater and the launch date( which also appaears as Date Created Conversion) on the kickstarter work sheet. Below is the line chart showing that the highest successful  theather outcome for Louise fundrasing was in May which has the total amount of success to be (111)

This analysis is presented in the chart below;![Image](https://github.com/Thaofeeqat/Kickstarters-analysis/blob/main/Outcome_vs_goals.png)
Other table that was created from this analysis is the parent category chart which shows the outcome of all categories ![Image](.https://github.com/Thaofeeqat/Kickstarters-analysis/blob/main/Parent%20Category%20Outcome.png)
